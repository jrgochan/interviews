# Thoughts

- Focus on the ~1/3 of my job at LANSCE involving teaching physicists how to navigate their computing needs.
- Mention ESS DMSC and running their container on LISDI
- Remember `modprobe`, `depmod`, `rmmod`, `lsmod`, `dmesg`, `strace`

# To-Do

- Play with `sar`
  - Refresh `vmstat`, `iostat`
- Research `sysctl` and kernel tuning more
- Refresh `cgroups`
- Refresh `systemd` in relation to IB/NVIDIA
- Remember `Multus` is a Kubernetes CNI "Container Network Interface" plugin
