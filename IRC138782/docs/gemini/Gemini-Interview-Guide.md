# **An Interview Preparation Briefing: The HPC/AI Linux Administrator / Scientist Role at Los Alamos National Laboratory**

## **Part I: Strategic Context \- Understanding the LANL Environment and the Role**

A successful candidacy for this position requires more than a demonstration of technical proficiency; it demands a nuanced understanding of the unique context in which these technical skills will be applied. Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is not a conventional technology enterprise. Its foundational mission, deeply rooted in national security, shapes every aspect of its operations, culture, and technical requirements.

### **The Mission and Culture of Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)**

The primary mission of LANL is to solve national security challenges through scientific and technological excellence. The laboratory's foremost responsibility is ensuring the safety, security, and reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile through the Stockpile Stewardship Program. This critical task is performed without resorting to underground nuclear testing, a reality that places an immense burden on high-fidelity simulation and modeling capabilities. The high-performance computing (HPC) systems at LANL, such as the Trinity supercomputer, are therefore not merely research tools but are indispensable instruments of national policy, providing the computational power necessary for these critical assessments. This role, as stated in the position description, directly supports this national security mission.
Born from the Manhattan Project in 1943, LANL has a historical legacy of tackling scientific and engineering problems of unprecedented scale and complexity. This history fosters a culture of innovation and a commitment to solving the world's most difficult challenges. While the core mission is nuclear deterrence, it is supported by a broad and diverse multidisciplinary research portfolio. This includes pioneering work in space exploration, geophysics, renewable energy, materials science, medicine, and artificial intelligence. The HPC infrastructure that this role will manage is a central, shared resource that underpins this wide spectrum of scientific inquiry.  
The laboratory's stated values are Service, Integrity, Teamwork, and Excellence. In a high-consequence environment where the work involves classified and sensitive data, these values are foundational. Integrity, particularly concerning security protocols, and teamwork, essential for collaboration among diverse scientific and technical teams, are paramount for any individual working within the institution. The work is not just about maintaining systems; it is about providing a stable, secure, and high-performance computational platform that serves as a cornerstone of U.S. national security. The reliability and integrity of the systems under this role's purview have direct and significant implications for the nation's strategic deterrence capabilities.

### **Deconstructing the Role: Administrator vs. Scientist**

The job title "HPC/AI Linux Administrator / Scientist" is a deliberate construction that signals a hybrid role requiring the integration of two distinct but complementary mindsets.
The **Administrator** mindset is focused on the core tenets of production systems: stability, reliability, security, automation, and repeatability. This aspect of the role involves the strategic design, construction, and operation of production infrastructure, including NVIDIA DGX/HGX pods and on-premise cloud-like environments. It encompasses the day-to-day operational discipline required to manage large-scale supercomputers, including participating in on-call duties to ensure constant availability.
The **Scientist** mindset, conversely, is focused on enabling and advancing research. This involves a deep understanding of modern AI/ML/LLM user workflows, developing new technical capabilities, and effectively communicating technical results. The role requires the creation of technical products such as documentation, presentations, and even technical papers for conferences, reflecting a culture where research and publication are highly valued. This aspect of the role positions the individual not merely as a service provider but as a collaborator in the scientific process, mentoring students and junior staff and helping researchers optimize their work for the laboratory's unique computational architectures.  
The ideal candidate, therefore, functions as a "Research Facilitator" or a "Computational Scientist with an Operations Focus." They must be capable of translating the needs of researchers—who require cutting-edge tools and maximum performance—into robust, secure, and scalable operational solutions.

### **Navigating the Scientist 2 vs. Scientist 3 Levels**

The position can be filled at either the Scientist 2 or Scientist 3 level, with the latter involving a significant increase in scope, leadership, and specialized expertise. Understanding the distinctions is crucial for tailoring interview responses to the appropriate level of experience and responsibility.

* **Scientist 2** focuses on demonstrated, hands-on expertise in the foundational areas of the role. Key requirements include advanced Linux administration, experience with configuration management tools, strong troubleshooting acumen, and a working knowledge of computer networking. The educational requirement is typically a Bachelor's degree in a STEM field with four years of relevant experience, with a salary range of $101,700 to $168,200.
* **Scientist 3** builds upon the Scientist 2 foundation by adding requirements for leadership and mastery of advanced HPC technologies. This includes demonstrated experience managing large, production Kubernetes clusters, deep expertise with high-performance interconnects like NVLink and InfiniBand, and proven project management skills, including planning, delegation, and reporting. The ability to formally mentor and lead junior team members is also a key requirement. This level typically requires a Master's degree and six years of experience, with a salary range of $122,300 to $206,300.

The following table provides a direct comparison of the requirements for each level.

| Area of Expertise | Scientist 2 Requirement | Scientist 3 Requirement |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Linux Administration** | Demonstrated knowledge of administering production Linux systems. | Demonstrated experience building, installing, and administering HPC systems. |
| **Configuration Management** | Demonstrated experience with tools like Ansible, Puppet, Chef, or Salt. | (Implied from Scientist 2\) |
| **Container Orchestration** | Not explicitly required. | Demonstrated experience managing, administering, and maintaining large production Kubernetes clusters. |
| **Networking** | Working knowledge of networking concepts and practices. | Experience with high-performance interconnects, preferably NVLink and InfiniBand networks. |
| **Leadership** | Not explicitly required; collaboration skills are emphasized. | Demonstrated experience with project planning and management, including leading complex projects. |
| **Mentoring** | Ability to provide assistance to peers. | Ability to mentor and lead individual junior team members and students. |

## **Part II: Foundational Pillars \- Core System Administration Expertise**

For a role of this nature at a premier research institution, "advanced" knowledge is the baseline expectation. A candidate must demonstrate a deep, principled understanding of Linux system administration, extending far beyond routine command execution.

### **Advanced Linux Administration for HPC**

Mastery of the Linux command line and proficiency in scripting with Bash, Perl, or Python are fundamental prerequisites. Python, in particular, has become the lingua franca for automation and tooling in modern AI and HPC environments.  
Beyond scripting, the role requires a sophisticated understanding of the operating system's internals. The position description notes the need to modify the OS, such as enabling or disabling kernel modules. This implies a need to understand the Linux kernel's architecture, how it interacts with specialized hardware like GPUs and InfiniBand adapters, and how to customize it to optimize for specific workloads. This level of expertise is critical for troubleshooting complex issues, such as a non-booting compute node within a large cluster, which requires a thorough grasp of the entire boot process from system firmware and bootloaders like GRUB to the initialization system, such as systemd.

### **System Performance Tuning at Scale**

In an HPC environment, performance tuning is not a reactive, ad-hoc task but a proactive and scientific process. It requires a methodical approach to identifying and resolving bottlenecks. The position explicitly calls for the ability to formulate and test hypotheses, investigate alternatives, and recommend solutions to technical problems.  
This process begins with proficient monitoring and diagnosis using a suite of standard Linux tools. A candidate must be adept at using utilities like top, htop, vmstat, iostat, and sar to gather metrics on CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network performance, and to interpret these metrics to pinpoint the root cause of a performance issue.  
A core skill is the ability to tune kernel parameters via sysctl. This involves more than knowing what the parameters do; it requires understanding *why* a particular setting should be changed for a given workload. For example, an administrator should be able to articulate the rationale for adjusting network buffer sizes (net.core.somaxconn), virtual memory behavior (vm.swappiness, vm.dirty\_ratio), or the maximum number of open file descriptors (fs.file-max) to optimize for a large-scale simulation or a data-intensive AI training job. This extends to optimizing CPU and memory usage through concepts like CPU governors, process scheduling priorities (  
nice, renice), and resource constraints using cgroups.

### **Security Hardening in a National Security Context**

At LANL, system security is not a best practice; it is a non-negotiable operational mandate governed by federal regulations. The systems managed in this role will process and store classified information vital to national security. Consequently, a deep and demonstrable commitment to security hardening is essential.  
The guiding philosophy is the principle of least privilege. An administrator must be proactive in minimizing the system's attack surface by removing all unnecessary software packages and services, disabling unused hardware ports, and implementing strict access controls.  
Secure configuration is a multifaceted task. It includes hardening the SSH service by disabling root login and enforcing public key authentication, configuring host-based firewalls like iptables or firewalld with a default-deny policy, and ensuring that file and directory permissions are appropriately restrictive. Experience with Mandatory Access Control (MAC) systems, particularly SELinux, is highly desirable as it provides a granular and robust mechanism for enforcing security policy, which is common in high-security environments.  
Finally, security is an ongoing process that relies on continuous monitoring. This involves understanding how to configure system auditing with tools like auditd, detecting intrusion attempts with software like fail2ban, and aggregating logs into a centralized Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, such as Splunk, which is explicitly mentioned as a desired skill. Each of these technical controls is not an end in itself but a means of protecting information whose compromise could have significant national security consequences.

## **Part III: The Automation and Orchestration Layer**

Managing HPC infrastructure at the scale of Los Alamos National Laboratory is impossible without a sophisticated automation and orchestration strategy. This requires expertise in tools that can provision, configure, and manage thousands of nodes consistently and reliably.

### **Configuration Management at Scale**

The position requires demonstrated experience with modern configuration and automation tools, citing examples such as Chef, Puppet, Ansible, Salt, or CFEngine. While knowledge of the underlying principles of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is key, it is also important to understand the architectural trade-offs between different tools. In HPC environments, agentless, push-based models like Ansible are often favored for their simplicity, as they do not require installing and maintaining client software on every compute node and communicate over the standard SSH protocol. A candidate should be prepared to discuss the pros and cons of these different approaches and articulate a reasoned choice for a given scenario.  
The following table provides a comparative analysis of the leading configuration management tools.

| Tool | Architecture | Language | Key Strengths for HPC | Potential Challenges in HPC |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Ansible** | Agentless / Push | YAML / Python | Simplicity, SSH-based, no inbound ports needed on clients, human-readable playbooks. | Sequential execution by default can be slower for very large node counts compared to parallel systems. |
| **Salt** | Agent-based / Push-Pull | YAML / Python | High-speed parallel execution via ZeroMQ, low-latency communication, highly scalable. | Can be more complex to set up and manage than Ansible; master can be a bottleneck. |
| **Puppet** | Agent-based / Pull | Puppet DSL / Ruby | Mature, model-driven, strong for enforcing state and managing complex dependencies across a heterogeneous fleet. | Steeper learning curve due to DSL and Ruby dependency; pull model can have latency in applying changes. |
| **Chef** | Agent-based / Pull | Ruby DSL | Highly flexible and powerful, strong for developer-centric workflows ("infrastructure as code"). | Steeper learning curve, requires programmer-level understanding of Ruby, complex setup. |

### **Containerization Strategies in HPC: Singularity/Apptainer vs. Docker**

While Docker has become the standard for containerization in the enterprise and cloud-native world, it presents a significant security vulnerability in a shared, multi-user HPC environment. The Docker daemon runs with root privileges, meaning any user with access to the Docker socket can potentially gain root access to the host system—an unacceptable risk in a secure facility like LANL.  
For this reason, the de facto standard for containerization in HPC is Singularity (now officially maintained by the Linux Foundation as Apptainer). Singularity was designed from the ground up for security and multi-tenancy in HPC contexts. Its key architectural advantages include a daemonless design that runs container processes with the same user privileges as the user who launched them, eliminating the risk of privilege escalation. Its images are single, portable  
.sif files, which simplifies sharing and archiving of scientific environments. Furthermore, it integrates natively with HPC-specific hardware like GPUs and high-speed interconnects, as well as with resource managers like Slurm. A common workflow involves a researcher building a container using Docker on a local machine, which is then converted to the Singularity image format for execution on the production cluster.  
The table below highlights the critical differences between these two technologies in an HPC context.

| Feature | Docker | Singularity/Apptainer |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Security Model** | Daemon runs as root, creating a potential for privilege escalation. | User inside the container is the same user outside; no privilege escalation. |
| **Daemon** | Requires a root-level daemon running on the host. | Daemonless architecture; runs as a standard user process. |
| **Image Format** | Layered file system, can be complex to distribute. | Single, portable .sif file, easy to copy and share. |
| **HPC Integration** | Can be complex to integrate with InfiniBand, MPI, and Slurm. | Native support for GPUs, InfiniBand, MPI, and schedulers like Slurm. |
| **User Experience** | docker run | singularity run/exec/shell |

### **Kubernetes for Scientific Workloads**

The role at LANL involves building and operating "on-premise cloud-like infrastructure for AI/ML/LLM needs" using Kubernetes. In an HPC center, Kubernetes coexists with traditional batch schedulers like Slurm, but they serve different purposes. Kubernetes is ideal for orchestrating containerized services and managing long-running, often user-facing, applications. This includes deploying ML inference endpoints, data science platforms like JupyterHub, and other components of the AI/ML workflow. It is generally not used for the large-scale, tightly-coupled parallel jobs that are the domain of the bare-metal supercomputer and Slurm.  
For the Scientist 3 level, the focus is on administering *large production Kubernetes clusters*. This requires expertise in managing specialized hardware resources, such as GPUs, using the NVIDIA device plugin to make them available to pods. It also involves debugging complex user workflows within the Kubernetes environment and ensuring the cluster's stability, security, and efficient resource utilization. An administrator must understand how to configure scaling mechanisms, such as the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for stateless services, and how to properly define CPU and memory requests and limits to ensure quality of service for training jobs. Familiarity with the broader MLOps ecosystem that runs on Kubernetes, such as Kubeflow for managing the machine learning lifecycle, would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the user base's needs.

## **Part IV: The High-Performance Computing (HPC) Stack**

This section details the specialized hardware and software that define a modern HPC environment. Deep, hands-on knowledge of these technologies is a core requirement for the position, particularly at the Scientist 3 level.

### **Hardware Architecture: NVIDIA DGX/HGX Pods**

A central responsibility of this role is to "design, build, and run production NVidia DGX/HGX pods". It is crucial to understand the distinction between these two platforms. NVIDIA DGX systems are fully integrated, turnkey "AI supercomputers in a box," combining NVIDIA hardware and an optimized software stack into a single, supported product. In contrast, NVIDIA HGX is a more flexible reference architecture or "building block" that server manufacturers like Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) use to design and build custom, high-density GPU systems.  
Given that LANL's newest supercomputer, Venado, is a collaboration between LANL, HPE, and NVIDIA, it is indicative of the laboratory's use of cutting-edge, custom-designed systems based on HGX-style principles rather than solely off-the-shelf DGX appliances. A candidate should be familiar with the key architectural components of these platforms, including high-speed NVLink for direct GPU-to-GPU communication, NVSwitch fabric to scale this communication across multiple GPUs, and the advanced liquid cooling systems required to manage the thermal density of these nodes.

### **High-Speed Interconnects: InfiniBand and NVLink**

The performance of any large-scale parallel application is fundamentally limited by the speed and latency of its communication fabric. A misconfigured or underperforming network can render a multi-million-dollar supercomputer ineffective for its primary mission.

* **InfiniBand (IB)** is the industry standard for high-bandwidth, low-latency node-to-node communication in HPC. Expertise with InfiniBand is an explicit requirement for the Scientist 3 level. A candidate must understand the basic architecture, which includes Host Channel Adapters (HCAs) in each node, a network of InfiniBand switches, and the crucial role of the Subnet Manager (SM) in initializing the fabric and managing routing. Essential troubleshooting skills include checking the physical and logical state of links using commands like  
  ibstatus and ibstat, verifying that the Subnet Manager is active with sminfo, and diagnosing configuration and performance issues.  
* **NVLink** is NVIDIA's proprietary interconnect technology designed for ultra-high-bandwidth communication *between GPUs* within a single server or across a multi-node pod via NVSwitch. This technology is critical for modern deep learning models, where massive amounts of data must be exchanged between GPUs during the training process.

### **Parallel and Distributed Storage**

The immense volume of data generated by modern simulations and AI models requires specialized storage systems capable of providing high-bandwidth, parallel access.

* **Lustre** is one of the most widely deployed parallel file systems in the HPC world. LANL's Trinity supercomputer, for example, utilizes a Lustre-based file system. An administrator must understand its distributed architecture, which consists of Metadata Servers (MDSs) to handle namespace operations, Object Storage Servers (OSSs) to store file data, and clients running on the compute nodes. A key concept to master is file striping, where a single large file is broken into chunks and distributed across multiple OSSs and their underlying Object Storage Targets (OSTs), enabling multiple clients to read and write to the file in parallel.  
* **Ceph** is mentioned as a desired qualification. It is a highly scalable, software-defined storage platform that provides object, block, and file storage from a single unified cluster. Its self-managing and self-healing properties make it a popular choice for building the kind of "on-premise cloud-like infrastructure" described in the job posting.  
* A working knowledge of the underlying local file systems, such as **ZFS, ext4, and XFS**, is also required. This includes understanding their respective strengths, features (e.g., ZFS's data integrity and snapshot capabilities), and performance characteristics in the context of serving as the backing storage for OSSs or for local node storage.

### **Workload Management: Administering the Slurm Scheduler**

The Slurm Workload Manager is the central nervous system of an HPC cluster, responsible for allocating resources to users, managing a queue of pending jobs, and launching those jobs on the compute nodes. An administrator must be proficient in its operation and configuration.  
The core architecture consists of the slurmctld daemon (the central controller), the slurmd daemon running on each compute node, and the optional slurmdbd for long-term accounting and database integration. Key administrative tasks revolve around using the  
scontrol command to view and modify the state of the system's components (nodes, jobs, partitions) and the squeue command to monitor the job queue. A deep understanding of the  
slurm.conf file is necessary to configure the system's behavior. An administrator must be able to troubleshoot common user issues, such as why a job is not starting, by using commands like sprio to inspect job priorities and understanding core scheduling concepts like partitions (queues), Quality of Service (QOS) levels, and backfill scheduling.

## **Part V: Supporting the AI/ML User Workflow**

A critical function of this role is to bridge the gap between the complex underlying infrastructure and the scientific work it is designed to enable. This involves deploying and managing user-facing services that make the HPC systems accessible and productive for a diverse community of researchers.

### **User-Facing Services: Deploying and Managing JupyterHub**

Jupyter notebooks are a primary interface for data scientists and AI/ML researchers to develop code, analyze data, and train models. JupyterHub is the standard solution for providing a multi-user Jupyter environment, giving each user their own isolated, server-managed notebook instance.  
An administrator should understand the fundamental architecture of JupyterHub, which includes the central Hub process that handles authentication and spawning, a configurable proxy that routes user traffic, and the individual single-user notebook servers. A highly scalable and common deployment pattern is "Zero to JupyterHub with Kubernetes," which leverages a Kubernetes cluster to dynamically spawn notebook servers as containerized pods for each user. This deployment model aligns directly with the Kubernetes expertise required for the Scientist 3 level. Administrative responsibilities include managing user access, customizing the user's software environment by installing necessary packages and libraries, monitoring resource usage, and troubleshooting user sessions that may become unresponsive or encounter errors.

### **Operational Monitoring and CI/CD Practices**

Modern systems administration, especially at scale, relies on robust monitoring and automated, code-driven management practices.

* **Monitoring:** The position description expresses a desire for experience integrating operational metrics into a monitoring system like Splunk. This demonstrates an expectation that the administrator will not only react to failures but will proactively monitor the health and performance of the entire HPC ecosystem. This includes collecting metrics on node health (CPU, memory, temperature), network performance (InfiniBand counters, latency), storage system utilization (Lustre I/O rates, capacity), and job scheduler statistics (queue lengths, GPU utilization). This data must then be ingested into a centralized platform for analysis, dashboarding, and alerting.  
* **CI/CD and Git:** The desired qualification of experience with Git, merge requests, and CI/CD pipelines indicates that LANL's HPC-OPS group employs an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) methodology. Under this model, all system configurations—such as Ansible playbooks, Kubernetes manifests, Slurm configuration files, and custom scripts—are stored and versioned in a Git repository. Changes are proposed via merge requests, which can be peer-reviewed, and then automatically tested and deployed through a CI/CD pipeline. This approach brings rigor, repeatability, and auditability to system management, which is essential in a high-security, production environment.

## **Part VI: The Human Element \- Communication, Mentorship, and Clearance**

In a collaborative, mission-driven institution like LANL, technical skills alone are insufficient. The ability to communicate effectively, contribute to the team's growth, and meet stringent security requirements are equally critical components of the role.

### **Excelling in a Collaborative Environment**

The position requires extensive interaction with world-class scientists, engineers, and technical peers. The job description repeatedly emphasizes the need for "effective verbal and written communication skills" to convey complex technical information to both technical and non-technical personnel. A candidate must be able to clearly explain the status of a system, the root cause of a problem, or the rationale for a design decision to a diverse audience.  
Teamwork is another core expectation. The role is situated within the HPC Operations Group and involves close collaboration with other group members and external vendors to maintain and evolve the laboratory's computing infrastructure.  
Mentorship is highly valued and serves as a key differentiator for the Scientist 3 level. National laboratories play a vital role in training the next generation of scientists and engineers, and staff are expected to contribute to this mission. A candidate should be prepared with specific examples of how they have mentored junior staff, guided students through technical projects, or helped peers develop new skills.

### **Navigating the DOE Q Clearance Process**

The ability to obtain and maintain a Department of Energy (DOE) Q clearance is a mandatory condition of employment. An active Q clearance is a desired qualification, indicating the candidate has already undergone this rigorous process.

* **What it is:** A Q clearance is the highest security clearance level granted by the DOE. It corresponds to the Top Secret level in other government agencies and is required for access to Restricted Data (RD) and Formerly Restricted Data (FRD), which specifically pertains to the design and function of nuclear weapons and related materials.  
* **The Process:** The clearance process begins with the submission of the **Standard Form 86 (SF-86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions**. This is an exhaustive document that requires detailed information about an individual's life history, typically covering at least the last 10 years. Areas of inquiry include residences, employment, education, family, foreign contacts and travel, financial history, criminal records, and personal conduct. Based on this form, a comprehensive background investigation is conducted by a federal agency like the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) or the FBI.  
* **Adjudication:** Upon completion of the investigation, the case is adjudicated. The decision to grant or deny a clearance is based on the 13 "Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information". This is not a simple check-box exercise but an evaluation based on the "whole person concept," which involves carefully weighing all available information, both favorable and unfavorable, to assess an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and loyalty to the United States. The government must have complete trust and confidence in individuals granted this level of access.

The most critical aspect of this process is absolute honesty and completeness on the SF-86. Deliberately omitting or falsifying information is a federal offense and is almost always considered more disqualifying than the underlying issue one might be attempting to conceal.

## **Part VII: Synthesis and Interview Strategy**

This final section provides a framework for integrating the technical and contextual knowledge into a coherent and effective interview performance.

### **Tying It All Together: A Day in the Life**

Be prepared to walk through complex, multi-faceted scenarios that test your ability to synthesize knowledge across different technology domains.

* **Scenario 1 (Reactive Troubleshooting):** *A researcher reports that their multi-node, distributed deep learning job, which previously ran in 8 hours, is now projected to take over 48 hours. The job is running on a Slurm-allocated partition of 16 GPU nodes. Describe your troubleshooting process from start to finish.*  
  * **A strong answer would include:**  
    1. **Information Gathering:** Check the Slurm job ID (scontrol show job) to verify the allocated resources. Ask the user if any code or data has changed.  
    2. **Node-Level Health:** Log into a few of the allocated nodes. Run nvidia-smi to check GPU health, temperature, power draw, and utilization. Use top/htop to check for unexpected CPU or memory usage.  
    3. **Interconnect Performance:** Use InfiniBand diagnostic tools (ibstat, perfquery) to check for link errors or flapping on the allocated nodes and their connected switch ports.  
    4. **Storage I/O:** Use tools like iostat on the nodes and monitor the Lustre OSSs to see if the job is I/O bound. Check for high await times, indicating storage contention.  
    5. **Application and System Logs:** Check system logs (/var/log/messages) and Slurm logs (slurmd.log) on the nodes for any hardware or system errors.  
    6. **Hypothesis and Escalation:** Based on the findings, form a hypothesis (e.g., "It appears to be a network bottleneck on switch X" or "The application is unexpectedly hitting swap"). Escalate to the networking or storage teams if necessary, providing clear data to support the hypothesis.  
* **Scenario 2 (Proactive Design \- Scientist 3):** *A new research initiative requires a dedicated, on-premise "cloud-like" environment for interactive data analysis and model development for a team of 20 scientists. Outline your project plan to design and deploy this system.*  
  * **A strong answer would include:**  
    1. **Requirements Gathering:** Meet with the scientific team to understand their workflows. What software do they need (TensorFlow, PyTorch)? What are their data sizes and access patterns? What are the security requirements?  
    2. **Architectural Design:** Propose a Kubernetes-based architecture. Specify the number of master and worker nodes, the type and number of GPUs required, and the networking design. Propose using Ceph for scalable, persistent storage for user data.  
    3. **Implementation Plan:** Detail the steps: rack and cable hardware, install and harden the base Linux OS, use Ansible to automate the configuration of all nodes, deploy the Kubernetes cluster, and configure GPU device plugins and storage classes.  
    4. **Service Layer Deployment:** Deploy JupyterHub on the Kubernetes cluster using the Zero-to-JupyterHub Helm chart. Configure authentication to integrate with the lab's identity management system. Create custom container images with the required scientific software pre-installed.  
    5. **Testing and Validation:** Develop a test plan to verify functionality, performance (especially GPU access and storage throughput), and security.  
    6. **Documentation and Training:** Create user-facing documentation and run a training session for the scientific team to introduce them to the new environment.

### **Actionable Interview Preparation Plan**

* **Weeks 1-2: Foundational Linux and Automation.**  
  * Solidify core Linux administration skills. Set up a home lab with VMs to practice kernel parameter tuning (sysctl) and security hardening (SSH, iptables, SELinux).  
  * Write complex Bash and Python automation scripts.  
  * Install Ansible and write playbooks to automate the configuration of your lab VMs.  
* **Week 3: Containerization and Orchestration.**  
  * Install Docker and Singularity/Apptainer. Practice converting a Docker image to a Singularity .sif file.  
  * Set up a small Kubernetes cluster (e.g., using minikube or k3s). Practice deploying pods, managing GPU resources (if you have a GPU), and configuring persistent storage.  
* **Week 4: HPC Stack.**  
  * Deeply review the architecture of Slurm, Lustre, and InfiniBand. Focus on the concepts, key components, and administrative commands.  
  * Study the differences between NVIDIA DGX and HGX architectures. Research LANL's Venado and Trinity supercomputers.  
* **Week 5: Behavioral and Strategic Preparation.**  
  * Prepare answers for behavioral questions using the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method. Focus on examples that demonstrate LANL's values:  
    * **Teamwork:** "Tell me about a time you had a technical disagreement with a colleague and how you resolved it."  
    * **Integrity:** "Describe a situation where you made a mistake that impacted a production system and how you handled it."  
    * **Service:** "Give an example of when you went above and beyond to help a user solve a complex problem."  
    * **Excellence:** "Tell me about the most technically complex system you have designed or administered."  
  * Prepare insightful questions to ask the interviewers. This demonstrates your engagement and deep thinking about the role.  
    * "How does the HPC-OPS group balance the need for production stability with the researchers' demand for cutting-edge, sometimes experimental, software and libraries?"  
    * "Could you describe the co-design process for a new system like Venado and the role a Scientist 3 would play in that process?"  
    * "What are the biggest challenges the team is currently facing in scaling the on-premise cloud and AI/ML infrastructure to meet the growing demands of the laboratory's research programs?"  
    * "How is the team leveraging CI/CD and Infrastructure-as-Code principles to manage the HPC environment, and what is the vision for evolving these practices?"
