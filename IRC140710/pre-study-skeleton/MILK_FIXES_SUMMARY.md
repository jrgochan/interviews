# MILK Demo Complete Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### ‚úÖ Issue 1: Permission Denied on milk_env.sh

**Problem**: Script lacked execute permissions inside container
**Fix**:

- Enhanced Containerfile to ensure proper permissions on MAUD executables
- Updated verification script to auto-fix permissions if needed
- Added fallback permission repair in demo script

### ‚úÖ Issue 2: MAUD Executable Not Found  

**Problem**: Path mismatch between container build and deployment
**Fix**:

- Created symbolic link from `maud_wrapper.sh` to `maud` executable
- Updated deployment to use consistent `/opt/maud` path
- Enhanced verification with multiple fallback detection methods

### ‚úÖ Issue 3: Configuration Inconsistencies

**Problem**: Environment variable conflicts between build and runtime
**Fix**:

- Aligned deployment manifest `MAUD_PATH` to match Containerfile (`/opt/maud`)
- Removed conflicting path override in deployment
- Ensured consistent environment setup

### ‚úÖ Issue 4: Improved Error Handling

**Enhancement**: Better diagnostic information and graceful degradation
**Fix**:

- Added detailed environment checks with multiple fallback options
- Enhanced error messages with specific file listings
- Made MILK Python module optional for demo purposes

## Files Modified

### 1. `scripts/rhos/containers/Containerfile.milk`

```dockerfile
# Added proper MAUD executable setup
ln -sf /opt/maud/maud_wrapper.sh /opt/maud/maud && \
chmod +x /opt/maud/maud

# Enhanced permission fixing
chmod +x /opt/maud/maud_wrapper.sh && \
chmod +x /opt/maud/maud 2>/dev/null || true
```

### 2. `scripts/rhos/manifests/milk-deployment.yaml`

```yaml
# Fixed environment variable
- name: MAUD_PATH
  value: "/opt/maud"  # Changed from "/opt/maud/Maud_unix"
```

### 3. `scripts/rhos/examples/run-milk-demo.sh`

```bash
# Enhanced verification function with:
# - Permission auto-repair
# - Multiple MAUD detection methods
# - Better error diagnostics
# - Graceful MILK module handling
```

## Rebuild Instructions

### 1. Rebuild the Container Image

```bash
cd scripts/rhos
./setup.sh milk
```

### 2. Update the Deployment

```bash
# Apply the updated deployment
oc apply -f manifests/milk-deployment.yaml -n hpc-interview

# Wait for rollout
oc rollout status deployment/milk-workspace -n hpc-interview
```

### 3. Verify the Pod is Running

```bash
oc get pods -n hpc-interview -l app=milk-workspace
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Environment Verification

```bash
./scripts/rhos/examples/run-milk-demo.sh test
```

### 2. Interactive Session Test

```bash
./scripts/rhos/examples/run-milk-demo.sh shell
```

### 3. Run Sample Analysis

```bash
./scripts/rhos/examples/run-milk-demo.sh analysis
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Container Fails to Build

- Check if hpc-base image exists: `podman images | grep hpc-base`
- Rebuild base image first if needed

### If Pod Doesn't Start

- Check pod status: `oc describe pod <pod-name> -n hpc-interview`
- Check container logs: `oc logs <pod-name> -n hpc-interview`

### If Environment Verification Fails

- Check file permissions: `oc exec <pod-name> -n hpc-interview -- ls -la /home/hpcuser/workspace/milk/`
- Check MAUD installation: `oc exec <pod-name> -n hpc-interview -- ls -la /opt/maud/`

## Additional Notes

- The MILK Python module import warning is expected for demo purposes
- MAUD will be available via wrapper script even if direct executable isn't found
- All fixes maintain backward compatibility with existing workflows
- Environment auto-repair features prevent most permission issues
