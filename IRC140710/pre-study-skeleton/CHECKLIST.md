# One-Page Checklist

- [ ] Spack environment builds cleanly (CPU + MPI; optional GPU).
- [ ] CI job submits to Slurm and runs tests; artifacts stored.
- [ ] ReFrame tests: module, MPI ring, I/O, GPU smoke; thresholds documented.
- [ ] Nsight Systems run on CUDA microbenchmark; one perf fix demonstrated.
- [ ] Debug demo with TotalView or Forge; deadlock/root cause write-up.
- [ ] Ansible role for a support/build host (Engineer-2 plus).
- [ ] PRE responsibilities & quals re-read; resume bullets aligned.
