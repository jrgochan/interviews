# MILK Demo Issues and Solutions

## Identified Problems

### 1. Permission Denied Error

**Issue**: `/home/hpcuser/workspace/milk/milk_env.sh: Permission denied`

- The `milk_env.sh` script lacks execute permissions within the container

### 2. MAUD Executable Not Found

**Issue**: `‚ùå MAUD executable not found`

- Path mismatch between Containerfile and deployment manifest
- Script expects different executable name/location than what's built

### 3. Configuration Inconsistencies

**Issues**:

- Containerfile sets `MAUD_PATH=/opt/maud`
- Deployment manifest overrides with `MAUD_PATH=/opt/maud/Maud_unix`
- Script looks for `$MAUD_PATH/maud` executable
- Container creates `maud_wrapper.sh` but script expects `maud`

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Fix Container Build

Update the Containerfile to properly configure MAUD executable paths and permissions.

### Solution 2: Fix Deployment Configuration

Align the deployment manifest environment variables with the container setup.

### Solution 3: Update Verification Script

Modify the demo script to correctly check for MAUD availability.

### Solution 4: Improve Error Handling

Add better error messages and fallback mechanisms.
